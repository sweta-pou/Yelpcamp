This project is a part of my web development course from udemy. Here you can view and book a campground. Owners can post their campgrounds.
Additional features implemented are map, payment(khalti), fuzzy search and email verification.
This project is implemented using node.js(express), MongoDB. Mapbox is used for the map, passport for authentication, and mailgun for email verification and booking confirmation.
